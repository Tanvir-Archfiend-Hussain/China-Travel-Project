                    <h2 class="text-center">Sally Yeh</h2>

                    <p>Yeh has Canadian citizenship. Born in Taipei, Taiwan, she immigrated to Canada at the age of four with her family and
                    grew up in Victoria, British Columbia. Yeh's singing career started in the early 1980s, shortly after her acting career
                    started as she sang songs specifically written for the movie soundtrack. She has released a total of thirty studio
                    albums, plus compilations and live recordings. Yeh speaks English, Mandarin and Cantonese in that order of proficiency.
                    Although her singing Cantonese is clear in songs, one can tell Cantonese is not her mother tongue when she speaks it.</P>
                    
                    <p>Yeh has also collaborated on a number of soundtracks (mostly on Tsui Hark's movies with scores by Wong Jim), including
                    "Lai Ming But Yiu Loi" from A Chinese Ghost Story (1987), which won the Best Original Song award at the 7th Hong Kong
                    Film Awards.</p>
                    
                    <p>Yeh has received the Most Popular Hong Kong Female Singer award at the Jade Solid Gold Top Ten Awards four times (1990,
                    1991, 1992, and 1993). In 1992, Sally Yeh collaborated with a couple of other western artists, recording "Dreaming of
                    You" with Tommy Page in 1992 and "I Believe in Love" with James Ingram the following year. On 17 July 1996, Yeh married
                    Hong Kong pop star and composer-producer George Lam. In 2002, Yeh re-entered the Cantopop market, released the record
                    "Can You Hear", and performed a series of concerts in different countries. In 2011, Sally Yeh received the Golden Needle
                    Award at the 33rd RTHK Top Ten Chinese Gold Song Music Award Ceremony.</p>
